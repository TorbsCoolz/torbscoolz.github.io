# torbscoolz.github.io
This is a landing page for TorbsCoolz' Resume and Projects, along with other major contributions. I'll most likely keep it active
I tried out markdown, but I'm prety comfortable with HTML and I use some really low-end hardware for fun. I think that people should try to make the internet like it used to be :)
